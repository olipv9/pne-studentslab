# To easily obtain the path and the arguments, you may use:

from urllib.parse import parse_qs, urlparse
url_path = urlparse(self.path)
path = url_path.path # we get it from here
arguments = parse_qs(url_path.query)

# To automatically render the form:

import jinja2 as j

def read_html_file(filename):
    contents = Path("html/" + filename).read_text()
    contents = j.Template(contents)
    return contents


contents = read_html_file("echo.html").render(context={"todisplay": text})  # provide a dictionary to build the form

# But to make this last sentence work, the form must have the line below
# wherever you want the text to be shown (provided variable text contains the characters you want to display).

# < p > {{context.todisplay}} < / p >
